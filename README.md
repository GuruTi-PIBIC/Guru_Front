# Guru_Front

This repository contains the front-end React app inside the `guru_ti/` folder.

To run the app:

1. Open a terminal and change directory to the app:

	cd guru_ti

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

	npm install

3. Start the development server:

	npm start

If you accidentally ran `npm install` in the repository root, a backup of the root `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` was moved into `backup_root_npm/` to avoid conflicts. Work from `guru_ti/` going forward.
